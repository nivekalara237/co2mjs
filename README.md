### The Common JS Library

`✨Common JavaScript Utilities ✅` is a collection of reusable, well-tested, and easy-to-use utility functions designed to simplify everyday JavaScript programming tasks. This library provides a set of commonly needed functionalities, ranging from array manipulations and object operations to string processing and date handling. Whether you are working on a web application, Node.js project, or any other JavaScript-based project, these utilities can help you write cleaner and more efficient code by reducing the need to reinvent the wheel.

❇️❇️ Key features include:

1. `Array Operations: Functions for sorting, filtering, flattening, and manipulating arrays.
2. `Object Utilities`: Tools for deep cloning, merging, and comparing objects.
3. `String Manipulations`: Handy methods for formatting, trimming, splitting, and joining strings.
4. `Date Handling`: Utilities for parsing, formatting, and calculating date differences.
5. `Type Checking`: Functions to determine data types, including custom type checks.
6. `Math Utilities`: Methods for performing common mathematical operations like rounding, averaging, and finding the maximum/minimum values.
7. `Random Generation`: Utilities for generating secure random numbers, strings, and IDs. 
8. `Numeric Manipulations`: Functions to handle numerical operations, including conversions, rounding, and precision handling. 
9. `Boolean Operations`: Tools for simplifying logical expressions and boolean evaluations
10. `Throwable Utilities`: Functions to create and manage custom errors, with tools for enhanced error handling and debugging.
11. `Miscellaneous`: Other helpful utilities such as debounce, throttle, and random ID generation.

This project is ideal for developers looking for a lightweight, dependency-free library to enhance their JavaScript coding experience. All utilities are optimized for performance and are designed to work seamlessly across different environments, including browsers and Node.js.
